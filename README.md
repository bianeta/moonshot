My project is a quiz to see what you are in our solar system. I wanted to learn more about the solar system, and this was a fun way to do it. 
I love to do quizzes, but dislike it when the questions don't have anything to do with the quiz. I tried to make my questions fun while still making them have purpose.
This is my second coding project by myself.
 In this project, I learned how to use JavaScript.  I struggled towards the end with my website not showing results, but in the end, I made it work.
